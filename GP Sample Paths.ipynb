Turns out that the motion of this pollen can be modelled well by a two-dimensional WP. It was Norbert Wiener (whom the process took its name after), who showed in 1923 that WPs have MS-continuous paths, but are nowhere MS-differentiable. Later on, in 1905, it was argued by none other than Einstein that this Brownian motion was the first physical evidence of the existence of atoms and molecules, which until then were by large only theoretical constructs.\n",

In particular, the given PSD $S_X$ is approximated in the interval $\\left[\\omega_k-\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}, \\omega_k+\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2} \\right]$ by $S_X(j \\omega_k)$ for some spacing $\\Delta\\omega > 0$ rad/sec and regularly-spaced angular frequencies $\\omega_k$. Obviously, the smaller $\\Delta\\omega$ is, the better the approximation to the intended GP.\n",

We saw this phenomenon in the previous section, when inspecting the PSD of processes with such characteristics."
